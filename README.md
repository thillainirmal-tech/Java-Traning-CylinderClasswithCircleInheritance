# Java Training: Cylinder Class with Circle Inheritance

## Overview
This project is a Java application designed to demonstrate inheritance in object-oriented programming. It includes a `Cylinder` class that inherits from a `Circle` class, showcasing how to extend functionality and reuse code through inheritance.

## Features
- Define a `Circle` class with properties and methods for radius and area calculation
- Define a `Cylinder` class that extends the `Circle` class, adding height and volume calculation
- Demonstrates inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in Java
- Simple and easy-to-understand code for educational purposes

## Installation
